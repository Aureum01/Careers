# Python Project Ideas for BI Analyst Roles

## 🏥 Healthcare
- **Readmission Risk Classifier** – Predict which patients are likely to be readmitted.  
- **Patient No-Show Predictor** – Use historical scheduling data to forecast missed appointments.  
- **Revenue Cycle Anomaly Detection** – Identify irregularities in billing and claims.  
- **Patient Sentiment Analyzer** – Process call transcripts and survey data for satisfaction insights.  
- **Care Workflow Optimizer** – Simulate how changes in scheduling affect wait times and outcomes.  
- **Clinical KPI Dashboard** – Automate patient care, engagement, and efficiency reporting.  

## 💰 Financial & Revenue Cycle
- **Revenue Forecasting Model** – Predict financial performance based on claims and patient data.  
- **Fraud Detection Script** – Catch suspicious billing or reimbursement patterns.  
- **KPI Automation for CFO Reports** – Generate monthly finance dashboards with Python + BI tools.  
- **Payment Delay Predictor** – Forecast which accounts are likely to default or delay.  
- **Claims Accuracy Validator** – Build a rules-based QA system for insurance claims.  

## 🏗 Construction / Operations (EquipmentShare style)
- **Equipment Utilization Tracker** – Analyze rental usage patterns to reduce idle time.  
- **Maintenance Risk Predictor** – Use machine data to forecast breakdowns before they happen.  
- **Cost Overrun Analyzer** – Identify drivers of budget overruns in construction projects.  
- **Project Timeline Simulator** – Model workforce + equipment changes on delivery deadlines.  
- **Safety Incident Dashboard** – Track and visualize safety events for risk management.  

## 🌐 General Business Intelligence
- **Multi-Source ETL Automation** – Merge and clean data from SQL, APIs, and flat files.  
- **Data Governance Checker** – Python script to audit schema, metadata, and missing values.  
- **Natural Language Query Engine** – Staff type plain text questions, get BI queries in return.  
- **Ad-hoc Report Validator** – Automate QA for BI dashboards (Tableau/Power BI/Tableau extracts).  
- **Churn Prediction Model** – Predict customer attrition for retention planning.  
- **Cross-Department Performance Dashboard** – Unified reporting for HR, Finance, Ops.
