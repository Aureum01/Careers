# Python Project Ideas for BI Analyst Roles

## 🏥 Healthcare
- **Readmission Risk Classifier** – Predict which patients are likely to be readmitted.  
- **Patient No-Show Predictor** – Use historical scheduling data to forecast missed appointments.  
- **Revenue Cycle Anomaly Detection** – Identify irregularities in billing and claims.  
- **Patient Sentiment Analyzer** – Process call transcripts and survey data for satisfaction insights.  
- **Care Workflow Optimizer** – Simulate how changes in scheduling affect wait times and outcomes.  
- **Clinical KPI Dashboard** – Automate patient care, engagement, and efficiency reporting.  

## 💰 Financial & Revenue Cycle
- **Revenue Forecasting Model** – Predict financial performance based on claims and patient data.  
- **Fraud Detection Script** – Catch suspicious billing or reimbursement patterns.  
- **KPI Automation for CFO Reports** – Generate monthly finance dashboards with Python + BI tools.  
- **Payment Delay Predictor** – Forecast which accounts are likely to default or delay.  
- **Claims Accuracy Validator** – Build a rules-based QA system for insurance claims.  

## 🏗 Construction / Operations (EquipmentShare style)
- **Equipment Utilization Tracker** – Analyze rental usage patterns to reduce idle time.  
- **Maintenance Risk Predictor** – Use machine data to forecast breakdowns before they happen.  
- **Cost Overrun Analyzer** – Identify drivers of budget overruns in construction projects.  
- **Project Timeline Simulator** – Model workforce + equipment changes on delivery deadlines.  
- **Safety Incident Dashboard** – Track and visualize safety events for risk management.  

## 🌐 General Business Intelligence
- **Multi-Source ETL Automation** – Merge and clean data from SQL, APIs, and flat files.  
- **Data Governance Checker** – Python script to audit schema, metadata, and missing values.  
- **Natural Language Query Engine** – Staff type plain text questions, get BI queries in return.  
- **Ad-hoc Report Validator** – Automate QA for BI dashboards (Tableau/Power BI/Tableau extracts).  
- **Churn Prediction Model** – Predict customer attrition for retention planning.  
- **Cross-Department Performance Dashboard** – Unified reporting for HR, Finance, Ops.

## 🖥 Local LLM (Ollama) – Offline, Secure, Controlled
- **Healthcare Report Summarizer** – Use Ollama locally to summarize patient engagement data for internal use without cloud exposure.  
- **Call Transcript Analyzer** – Run offline NLP to classify patient sentiment from engagement center calls.  
- **QA Validator for BI Dashboards** – Local model checks Power BI/Excel dashboards against business rules.  
- **Data Governance Assistant** – Ollama reviews datasets for schema mismatches, anomalies, and policy compliance.  
- **Offline Natural Language Query Tool** – Staff type questions (“show missed appointments last quarter”) and Ollama translates to SQL queries.  
- **Risk & Compliance Summaries** – Generate secure executive briefs locally from sensitive healthcare/finance datasets.  

## ☁️ Remote LLM (Railway.app) – Scalable, API-Driven
- **Multi-Client Report Generator** – Host an API for Ensemble-style BI teams to generate healthcare revenue cycle summaries.  
- **Cross-Department Q&A Bot** – Expose a REST API where staff query financial, HR, or operational data in plain English.  
- **Predictive Churn Analysis** – Use a hosted LLM to summarize churn drivers across multiple regions and output BI-ready insights.  
- **ETL Log Interpreter** – Send ETL job logs to an LLM on Railway.app for auto-diagnosis of failures.  
- **Financial Forecast Narratives** – Automated narrative generation from models (e.g., revenue predictions → plain text for leadership).  

## 🔀 Hybrid (Ollama + Railway.app) – “Best of Both Worlds”
- **Secure Data → Remote Insights** – Run preprocessing + anonymization locally with Ollama, then push cleaned data to Railway for advanced LLM analysis.  
- **Offline → Online BI Workflow** – Analysts run quick checks with Ollama, then trigger remote model for large-scale, multi-department report generation.  
- **Healthcare + Financial Compliance Checker** – Ollama validates PHI-sensitive data locally; Railway-hosted LLM generates non-sensitive business summaries.  
- **Project Risk Simulator** – Ollama handles scenario inputs offline; Railway generates stakeholder-facing explanations and recommendations.  
- **Interactive BI Assistant** – Local model handles quick SQL/NLP queries; cloud model handles cross-org queries with heavier processing.
